**LanaBLAS** is a repository primarily used for testing the development of CPython extension modules with external dependencies, such as ([OpenBLAS](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS)). It's a work-in-progress memetic project aimed at having fun and learning new things.


## Install 

Actually, the package is currently only available for macOS x86. Wheels for ARM and Linux platforms will be added to the PyPI registry as soon as possible.

```console
pip install lanablas==0.1.3
```

## Example 

```python
from lanablas import Matrix

a = Matrix.ones(3,3)
print(a)
print(type(a), a.shape)

b = Matrix.eye(3)
print(b)
print(type(b), b.shape)

c = a + b
print(c)
print(type(c), b.shape)
```
